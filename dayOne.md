Benefits of reverse debugging:

* everything is in the recording
* no need to recreate the customer environment
intermittent bugs need a single reproduction
* share with subject matter experts
* deterministic execution
* same exact behavior everyt time in any machine
* easy to use
* no code or compilation needed
* record/replay in different machines
* impact resources once

Some Available Tools:
* Pin Play developed by Intel
* RR (OS)
* TTD supports Windows only
* UndoDB supports Linux fully and used commonly in commercial scenarios

## Is AI Sexist? How Training Data Can Reinforce Gender Stereotypes presented by Emily Maxie

VP of Marketing at Very

"But algorithms can go wrong, even have deeply destructive effects with good intentions. And whereas an airplane thatâ€™s designed badly crashes to the earth and everyone sees it, an algorithm designed badly can go on for a long time, silently wreaking havoc." -Cathy O'Neill

AI inherits our bias

AI capture trends in human behavior in the past & present and projects them on the future

Tay.ai designed by Microsoft - picked up on speech patterns from those that interacted with it (went from positive - to very negative)

 Some ways to combat bias in AI:
 * have a trained data scientist build (or at least audit your AI)
 * ensure you have a large, diverse & accurately labeled dataset
 
 * uncover you bias "blind spots"
 * actively combat bias
